0;Prison Cell;You find yourself in a cold corridor. Torches on the wall, doors around you. You're wondering which one should lead to the exit. You hear someone sobbing from behind the right door. Maybe you should check if everything is okay? You hear nothing from the door opposite of your prison cell. You feel warmth from the left door and you smell something... Is it chicken?;left;I could use a little warmth.;1;up;Is anybody in here?;2;right;Hold on, the rescue is coming!;3
1;Kitchen;You've entered the cozy warm kitchen. Your nose was right, they've had chicken for dinner (or for lunch. I don't know the time and neither do you. For the first wrist watch you'll need to wait until 1868. Maybe we should wait for it outside the castle. Hey stop it! Put that chicken down, we've got more important things to do... Where were we? Oh right... ) All these doors where to go now? The right door leads to our cell as we know. The door in front of us is open, it looks like there is a big table and a bunch of chairs.  From the left door you hear a buzzing or sawing noise. Who the hell keeps bees in a basement?;left;What's this buzzing noise?;6;up;Is it a round table?;5;right;Jail... Just visiting.;0
2;Storage;You've entered a storage room. All sorts of tools lay around here. That pickaxe might come handy. Put it in your pocket. Trust me it will fit into your pocket. You see? You're in a video game, what were you expecting? See a new pickaxe already spawned... Like clockwork. The door behind you leads back to your cell. You peek through the keyhole of the left door and see a huge table with chairs. You feel a chill breeze from under the right door, might be coming from outside?;left;Is it a round table?;5;down;Jail... Just visiting.;0;right;Is this the Wind of Change?;4
3;Torture Chambers;You were wondering who was crying? It's a young lady who is the apprentice of the local witch. She is sobbing because she was captured in an undercover guard raid (What do you mean it's not historically accurate?), and now she has to write down all her astrology and tarot knowledge so the guards can see into the future. She says she will give you free fortune-telling based on your zodiac sign if you save her. Step aside, she is beyond saving... Zodiac signs... Pfff... The right door leads to your cell. You feel a chill breeze from the door in front of you. Wonder where the left door is leading.;left;Jail... Just visiting.;0;up;Is this the Wind of Change?;4;right;Hello... Is anybody in here?;6
4;Room under construction;You enter a room which is in a horrible condition. In the corner there is a nonfunctional medieval elevator. So probably it won't help us to get out of here. From the right door you hear no noise. From the door below you hear somebody sobbing, I wonder who it could be... From the right... Oh my God, is this... fresh air??? Could this be our way out? It might be worth a try to dig through this wall with your hands or with a pickaxe if you have one (or more) in your pocket. Don't look at me that way, I'm just a Narrator. I'm not doing that kind of work.;left;Is anybody in here?;2;down;Hold on, the rescue is coming!;3;right;*In Scottish accent* FREEDOOOOOOM;7
5;Dining Room;You enter the dining room. For a brief moment you (and because of poor lighting) you've thought you were looking at a classic Arthurian round table, but this one is actually triangle shaped. How disappointing. All this modern furniture... They must be from those two Swedish Furniture Merchants (Erik Ikeson and Lars Keason, those two always sell their Swedish furniture in parts and the customer has to put them together based on their drawn description and they are sending their pigeons with their monthly newsletter... I'll send them a pigeon as well regarding my coffee table I've ordered from them last month) you saw last week on the local market. The door behind you is open and the scent of chicken is attracting you. You hear no sound from the right door. From the left door you hear some buzzing noises.;left;What's this buzzing noise?;6;down;Look at all these chicken;1;right;Is anybody in here?;2
6;Guards Room;You enter the room and you silently close the door. Based on the buzzing noises you've thought here is a swarm of bees sawing down a whole forest... But actually the room is full of sleeping guards. You smell some booze. You're not so different from them after all. At least now you know where all your taxes are going (and you begin to understand why some people risk tax evasion, but who we are to judge. You're just a medieval person with a Narrator). From the left you hear nothing. In the keyhole of the door in front of you see a huge table with chairs. From the right door you smell some chicken and feel warmth.;left;Hello... Is anybody in here?;3;up;Is it a round table?;5;right;I could use a little warmth.;1
