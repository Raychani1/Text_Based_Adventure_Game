Welcome to Prison Escape: Medieval Edition
You wake up in a dungeon prison cell of Ashington Hold after a night out with your friends. 
Maybe that last bottle of rum was a bit over the line. 
You stand up from the ground where you were sleeping, dust yourself off and you see that the intern prison guard forgot his keys in the lock of your cell. 
Classic intern move. You don't hear any noises so you grab the keys once you have opened the door. 
Who knows, it might come handy later (or not). 
You silently open the screeching door of your cell and step out of it.
